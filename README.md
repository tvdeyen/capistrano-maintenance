Capistrano Maintenance Extension
=================================

This gem simply offers the recently removed `deploy:web:disable` and `deploy:web:enable` tasks to your Capistrano deployment.

Usage
-----

Install the gem via rubygems:

`gem install capistrano-maintenance`

And put this line into your deploy.rb file:

`require 'capistrano/maintenance'`

That's it. Everthing works like expected.
